Ok, so here is a quick project I was working on until I got bored. I'm sure I'll become more interested when iGoogle is killed off.

This is more or less a replica I was working on, but without mail...

Hopefully it works well for people.

The DB is in the DB folder
The HTML is in the HTML folder

Rendered HTML is for people who don't want to run this on a server or don't have PHP


Enjoy
